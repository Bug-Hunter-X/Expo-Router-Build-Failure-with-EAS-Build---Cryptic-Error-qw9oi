While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the expo-router.  The error message was cryptic and didn't point to a specific file or line.  The app would build successfully in development mode, but building the release version (using EAS Build) would fail. The error message was similar to: `Error: Failed to compile asset ... Some files related to expo-router could not be processed`
